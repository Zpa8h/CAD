# CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview

**CAD** is a new project repository in its initial setup phase. No application code, build system, or dependencies have been added yet.

## Repository Structure

```
CAD/
├── CLAUDE.md          # AI assistant guidance (this file)
└── README.md          # Project readme
```

## Current State

- Single initial commit with only `README.md`
- No source code, configuration files, or dependencies defined
- No build system, test framework, or CI/CD pipeline configured
- No `.gitignore` file

## Development Setup

No setup steps are required yet. Clone the repository and begin adding project files.

## Git Conventions

- **Remote**: origin
- **Commit signing**: Enabled (SSH key)
- **Branch naming**: Feature branches use descriptive prefixes (e.g., `claude/`, `feature/`, `fix/`)

## Guidelines for AI Assistants

- Read existing files before proposing modifications
- Keep solutions minimal and focused on what is requested
- When initializing the project, recommend adding a `.gitignore` appropriate to the chosen language/framework
- Update this file as the project structure evolves
